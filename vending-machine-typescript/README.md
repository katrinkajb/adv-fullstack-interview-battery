# Vending Machine

You are developing a vending machine. Your component deals with monetary
exchange. A user deposits money into the vending machine, selects a product, and
the product is provided along with proper change.

Proper change is defined as using the largest denominations possible using
American coinage. If the change is 86 cents, the output will be 3 quarters, 1
dime, and 1 penny.

Once your submissions is ready, open a pull request as normal and schedule time
with a TA to go over your code.

## Rubric

| Rubric                                                                           | Points |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| The program accepts inputs of `--item-cost` and `--payment`.                     | 5      |
| The program prints the coins returned (see formatting section) and success/fail. | 5      |
| Select and implement one of the personal flair items.                            | 5      |
| Select and implement another of the personal flair items (extra credit).         | 10     |


## Formatting

The program must output all coin types supported, each with its own line. The
general format is `<coin name>: <number of coins>`. So for quarters, you would
see `Quarters: 3` for 75 cents. Numbers should be padded out to the largest
coin type, plus a space between the colon and the number. For example:

``` text
Quarters: 3
Nickels:  1
```

Coin types are sorted from highest denomination to lowest denomination.

Total change is printed afterwards as `Total Change: <amount>`. Include the
currency glyph in the appropriate location for that currency.

All submissions will be run through automation prior to being submitted to the
development team for deliberation. Candidates whose submissions that fail to
follow the formatting rules will not be considered for employment. Here at
Widget Co, we really value the exactness of our requirements for our widgets.

## Personal Flair

This assignment requires that you do more than implement the minimum
requirements listed above. Additionally, add some of your personal flair to the
code. You have strengths and weaknesses like everyone else. It's time to show
off what you value and what you're good at. Select one of these (there are
rubric entries for each). A second one is worth extra credit.

When doing these, any additional functionality or code brought about by flair
still is subject to the other bit of flair you have. So if you chose TDD and
Support Other Currencies, the additional currency support needs to also be
tested, and test coverage needs to still be at 100%. If you chose JSDoc and
Support Other Currencies, the `--currency` argument needs to be in the usage
print out.

### JSDoc Everywhere!

You live by this mantra:

> Programs are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to
> execute.
> 
> -Harold Abelson

Your programs are not only readable, they are understandable! Part of how you
accomplish this is you add lots of comments to your code everywhere. Your
program uses [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) to comment every function, class, and
each file has a comment header with an explanation of why you have it and what
it does.

Additionally, your program prints [usage
information](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap12.html)
when given the `--help` argument, or if the `--item-cost` and `--payment`
arguments are not supplied.

Be sure to note this in your submission.

### TDD - Test Drive or Die

You wrote unit tests for every bit of functionality in your code. You live by
this sentiment: If it's not tested, it doesn't exist.

Your submission includes running the test suite in its GitHub Actions.

### Support Other Currencies

To solve a problem in the small case shows both small understanding and is a
waste of time. You prefer to solve a problem once, and forever for all of its
cosmetic variations. To you, fundamental, logical laws are your `food-transport`
and `edible-lubricant`. 

Don't just add support for one more currency, add support for _all existing and
future currencies_. Your program looks for a `currencies.json` file which
defines currency types, their formatting, and an abbreviation for the currency.

Additionally, your program now accepts a `--currency` argument (which defaults
to `USD` for backwards compatibility purposes) that allows selecting from
`currencies.json`.

The JSON file has an array of currencies. The TypeScript definitions for a
currency is:

``` typescript
type Coin = {
  name: string,
  value: number,
}

type Currency = {
  abbreviation: string,
  coins: ReadonlyArray<Coin>,
  format: string,
}
```

Remember - you solved this problem permanently - so any future or imaginary
coinage should work with this system, so long as it is provided in the
`currencies.json`.
